Design Pattern used: Page Object Model (POM) 
“A page object is an object-oriented class that serves as an interface to a page of your [application under test]. The tests then use the methods of this page object class whenever they need to interact with the UI of that page. The benefit is that if the UI changes for the page, the tests themselves don’t need to change, only the code within the page object needs to change. Subsequently all changes to support that new UI are located in one place.” — Seleniumhq.org
